## 📜 About

Our website simulates **Forest Degradation** over the years, offers potential solutions, and generates awareness among the masses. Forests globally are facing significant environmental degradation due to deforestation, unsustainable practices, and the effects of climate change.

Although efforts to raise awareness are ongoing, many people remain disconnected from the long-term consequences of their actions on the environment, especially at the local level. Traditional environmental education methods often fail to engage personally, limiting people's motivation to take meaningful action.

This project bridges the gap by offering an **interactive**, **personalized**, and **impactful approach** to environmental education, encouraging individuals to understand their local environmental challenges and take immediate steps to make a difference.
